# obtain_lock LOCKFILE COMMAND
#
# Tries once to obtains a lock via ln -s LOCKINFO LOCKFILE, to protect
# against COMMAND running concurrently.  Returns success (zero) iff
# lock was obtained.  Does not block, although may prompt for user
# guidance if running interactively - cross-checks lock with process
# table and does the sensible thing in each case.
#
# Assumes that /proc/$pid/cmdline of the resulting command will
# contain the first word of COMMAND.  This is so it can check whether
# the lock has become stale and another process has assumed $pid.  If
# this assumption is broken, and a second attempt is made to obtain
# the lock, it will incorrectly treat the valid lock as a stale one,
# and attempt to remove it.
#
# N.B. Any code calling this function is responsible for clearing the
# lock when COMMAND stops!
#
# Sample usage follows:
#
#   clean_up () {
#       [ -L "$LOCK" ] && rm "$LOCK"
#   }
#
#   obtain_lock "$LOCK" "$cmd" || exit 1
#   # Signal must be trapped *after* obtaining lock, otherwise failure
#   # to obtain the lock would remove an active lock.  This leaves a
#   # tiny window within which unexpected failure of the script could
#   # leave a stale lock.
#   trap clean_up EXIT

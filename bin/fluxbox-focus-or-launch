Usage: $me [OPTIONS] WINDOW-PATTERN LAUNCH-CMD
Options:
  -h, --help     Show this help and exit
  -c, --class    Match WINDOW-PATTERN against class rather than title
  -t, --toggle   If matching window is focused, minimize it; otherwise focus/launch
  -f, --focus    Focus the window after launching (if launched)

WINDOW-PATTERN is a regexp matching the window title or class.
LAUNCH-CMD is a command for launching the program if it's not found.

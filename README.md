# Adam's Xorg desktop configuration

This is a collection of files which configures my Xorg desktop in the
way I like it.  These days I use XFCE, having in the past
[tried GNOME and KDE](http://blog.adamspiers.org/2011/11/29/linux-desktop-community-outraged-by-latest-torvalds-comments/),
but most of the stuff here is fairly agnostic to desktop environment,
aiming to do things in a mostly standards-compliant way where
possible.

This repository's history dates back to the year 2000, so beware that
there is probably some cruft.

## Usage

Personally I just [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) this to
my home directory, but I wouldn't recommend anyone else doing that,
since a lot of the stuff here is targetted at my personal taste.
Instead I'd recommend just browsing around and cherry-picking any
files which look useful to you.

## Documentation

-   [Userscripts and bookmarklets for generating references/links to web pages](lib/browser/userscripts/page-id-helpers/README.md)

Other than the above, there are no docs yet; sorry.  If you want to
know how one particular thing works, just
[get in touch](mailto:desktop-config@adamspiers.org) and I'll try to
document it for you.

! xmodmap $Id$	
!
! for PC keyboards
!
!
! Remember the following points when altering this file:
!
! 1. This xmodmap can have a relative rather than absolute effect,
!    e.g. Caps_Lock and Control_L are swapped back if they have already
!    been swapped.
!
! 2. Remember the bit about exactly when xmodmap evaluates keysyms
!    (i.e. maps them to their corresponding current keycodes).
!
! 3. If there's an error, no changes take effect at all. 
!
! 4. xmodmap doesn't let you make a keysym into a modifier if
!    it isn't already attached to a real key.


! Caps_Lock becomes a control modifier.

remove Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L

! BackSpace sends BackSpace code, not Delete code
keycode 22 = BackSpace

! Turn right Alt (AltGr or <> on HHKL) into hyper 
remove mod3 = Mode_switch
keycode 113 = Hyper_R
add mod4 = Hyper_R

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! HHKL only

! backslash/pipe key
keycode 51 = backslash bar

! Left Alt
keycode 115 = backslash bar

! Right Alt
keycode 116 = numbersign asciitilde

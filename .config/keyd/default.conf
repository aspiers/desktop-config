# keyd configuration - equivalent to Adam's XKB setup
# Based on analysis of .xkb/symbols/adam* files
#
# To find a keyboard's USB ID:
#   sudo keyd -m              # Then press a key
#   lsusb | grep -i keyboard  # List USB devices
#
# Note: Built-in laptop keyboards still use USB IDs via internal USB
# or PS/2-to-USB bridges

# Default configuration - applies to unmatched keyboards

# Most / all remappings are keyboard-specific in the XKB config
# Only truly universal mappings go here
